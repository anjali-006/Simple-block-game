HOW IT WORKS

- The car starts at the bottom and moves horizontally with keyboard events.
- Obstacles are generated at random x-positions at a fixed interval.
- Each obstacle falls down at a constant speed.
- If the car’s and obstacle’s positions overlap — collision is detected.
- Game resets automatically after collision.
