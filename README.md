===========================
🧠 HOW IT WORKS
The car starts at the bottom and moves horizontally with keyboard events.

Obstacles are generated at random x-positions at a fixed interval.

Each obstacle falls down at a constant speed.

If the car’s and obstacle’s positions overlap — collision is detected.

Game resets automatically after collision.
